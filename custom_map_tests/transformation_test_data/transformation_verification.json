The findings of this research effort while tentative, seem to indicate that there is a definite need to upgrade the Latin American knowledge base both in textbook content and among teachers. Few of the texts are considered adequate in their treatment of Latin America. Some, especially those for below average readers, present a slanted, even distorted picture of Latin American reality. While World History teachers appear to be more knowledgeable about Latin America than teachers in general, lack of knowledge and stereotyping are clearly manifested in certain persisting beliefs about the region. While this is a narrow research effort, it explores the intriguing notion that what is often considered legitimate knowledge in our classrooms can in fact be quite inadequate.

He served as American ambassador to Czechoslovakia between 1983 and 1986. In his role as ambassador, Luers hosted a range of American artists and writers in the Czechoslovak capital, in a bid to \u201cchange the vision\u201d of American power from that of a military to a cultural force. Through such cultural diplomacy, Luers made contact and struck up friendships with prominent Czechoslovak dissidents, including V\u00e1clav Havel. Luers witnessed Havel\u2019s transition from dissident to president first-hand and, later, hosted V\u00e1clav Havel in New York City on his first visit in office. Luers has also served as American Ambassador to Venezuela, and as a diplomat in the former Soviet Union. Today, he teaches at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs.
